## Development Process

### Code Quality & Documentation

- **Use established design patterns**: Follow established design patterns such as Checks-Effects-Interactions, Pull over Push, and Guard Check.
- **Comment your code thoroughly**: Document the purpose of each function and any non-obvious behavior.
- **Maintain consistent style**: Use a linter and formatter to maintain a consistent coding style.
- **Use meaningful variable names**: Make your code self-documenting with clear variable and function names.

### Version Control & Review

- **Use version control**: Track all changes using Git or similar system.
- **Conduct peer reviews**: Have other developers review all code changes.
- **Document design decisions**: Keep records of important design decisions and trade-offs.
- **Maintain a security-focused changelog**: Document security considerations with each version.

### Dependency Management

- **Use audited dependencies**: Only use dependencies that have been professionally audited.
- **Lock dependency versions**: Specify exact versions of dependencies to prevent unexpected updates.
- **Stay updated**: Keep dependencies updated to include security fixes.
- **Minimize external dependencies**: Each dependency increases attack surface; only use what you need.

## Contract Design Principles

### Simplicity & Modularity

- **Keep contracts simple**: Simpler contracts are easier to reason about and less prone to bugs.
- **Use modular design**: Break functionality into smaller, well-defined contracts.
- **Single responsibility principle**: Each contract should have one primary responsibility.
- **Favor composition over inheritance**: Prefer composition patterns over complex inheritance hierarchies.

### Upgradability & Maintenance

- **Consider upgradability patterns**: Proxy patterns can allow for upgrades but add complexity.
- **Plan for contract retirement**: Design how contracts will be deprecated and replaced.
- **Include contract metadata**: Version numbers and documentation URLs in contract storage.
- **Document upgradeability risks**: Be transparent about centralization risks in upgradable contracts.

### Access Control

- **Implement thorough access controls**: Clearly define who can call which functions.
- **Use role-based access control**: For complex systems, define roles rather than relying on a single owner.
- **Implement time locks**: For sensitive operations, require a delay between proposal and execution.
- **Validate inputs thoroughly**: Check that all function inputs meet expected parameters.

## Common Vulnerabilities

### Reentrancy

**Problem**: External calls to untrusted contracts can allow attackers to reenter your contract before state updates are completed.

**Prevention**:
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern (validate, update state, then make external calls)
- Use reentrancy guards (mutex locks) like OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- Minimize external calls where possible
- Be aware of cross-function reentrancy where one function updates state that another relies on

**Example**:
```solidity
// Vulnerable
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // External call before state update
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
    
    // State update after external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
}

// Secure
function withdraw(uint256 amount) public nonReentrant {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    
    // State update before external call
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    
    // External call after state update
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

### Access Control Issues

**Problem**: Missing or flawed access controls allow unauthorized users to execute privileged functions.

**Prevention**:
- Use OpenZeppelin's Ownable or AccessControl for standard implementations
- Explicitly define and document the permission model for your contract
- Implement multi-signature requirements for highly sensitive operations
- Emit events for all access control changes

**Example**:
```solidity
// Vulnerable
function withdrawFunds(address recipient) public {
    // No access control
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}

// Secure
function withdrawFunds(address recipient) public onlyOwner {
    (bool success, ) = recipient.call{value: address(this).balance}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

### Arithmetic Issues

**Problem**: Integer overflow/underflow and precision loss from division can lead to unexpected results.

**Prevention**:
- Use Solidity 0.8.0+ which includes built-in overflow/underflow checks
- Or use SafeMath for older Solidity versions
- Be careful with precision in division operations
- Consider using fixed-point arithmetic libraries for precise calculations

**Example**:
```solidity
// Vulnerable (in Solidity < 0.8.0)
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}

// Secure
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}
```

### Gas-Related Issues

**Problem**: Gas limits and costs can affect contract execution, causing denial of service or unpredictable behavior.

**Prevention**:
- Avoid unbounded operations (e.g., iterating over unbounded arrays)
- Use batch processing with size limits for large operations
- Be careful with gas-dependent logic
- Test functions with realistic gas conditions

**Example**:
```solidity
// Vulnerable
function distributeRewards(address[] memory recipients) public {
    // Unbounded loop can exceed block gas limit
    for (uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        sendReward(recipients[i]);
    }
}

// Secure
function distributeRewards(address[] memory recipients) public {
    require(recipients.length <= MAX_BATCH_SIZE, "Batch too large");
    for (uint i = 0; i < recipients.length; i++) {
        sendReward(recipients[i]);
    }
}
```

### Front-Running

**Problem**: Miners or observers can see pending transactions and insert their own transactions ahead to profit.

**Prevention**:
- Implement commit-reveal schemes for sensitive operations
- Use minimum/maximum acceptable values for trades
- Consider private mempools or flashbots for sensitive transactions
- Design with the expectation that transaction order is not guaranteed

### Logic Errors

**Problem**: Flawed business logic can lead to unexpected contract behavior.

**Prevention**:
- Create detailed specifications before implementation
- Build extensive test suites covering normal and edge cases
- Conduct formal verification where feasible
- Use invariant testing to verify state properties hold across transactions

## Testing & Verification

### Testing Strategies

- **Write comprehensive unit tests**: Test each function in isolation.
- **Create integration tests**: Test interactions between components.
- **Perform invariant testing**: Use property-based testing to verify invariants.
- **Test edge cases explicitly**: Zero values, max values, empty strings, etc.
- **Conduct fuzzing**: Use tools like Echidna to discover unexpected issues.

### Security Tools

- **Static analyzers**: Use tools like Slither, Mythril, and MythX.
- **Linters**: Use Solhint or Ethlint to enforce best practices.
- **Formal verification**: Consider tools like Certora for critical contracts.
- **Gas analyzers**: Optimize gas usage without sacrificing security.
- **Coverage tools**: Ensure high test coverage of your codebase.

## Deployment & Operations

### Deployment Process

- **Use a deployment checklist**: Create a standardized procedure for deployments.
- **Verify constructor arguments**: Double-check all initialization parameters.
- **Verify deployed bytecode**: Ensure compiled bytecode matches what's on-chain.
- **Consider timelocks**: Implement delays for sensitive operations.
- **Verify on block explorers**: Publish and verify your source code on Etherscan.

### Monitoring & Response

- **Monitor transactions**: Implement alerts for unusual activity.
- **Create incident response plans**: Document procedures for various emergency scenarios.
- **Set up a security contact**: Have a clear way for researchers to report issues.
- **Consider bug bounties**: Incentivize responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Emergency Response

### Circuit Breakers

- **Implement pause functionality**: Allow freezing the contract in emergencies.
- **Define emergency roles**: Designate who can trigger emergency actions.
- **Test emergency functions**: Ensure emergency procedures work as expected.
- **Plan for recovery**: Document how to restore normal operations after an emergency.

### Upgradeability

- **Understand upgradeability trade-offs**: Recognize the centralization risks of upgradeable contracts.
- **Document upgrade procedures**: Create clear processes for upgrades.
- **Test upgrade paths**: Verify that state is maintained across upgrades.
- **Consider governance**: For decentralized protocols, implement community governance for upgrades.
